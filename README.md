# weatherreport

Hello Friends!

 With the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript I develop a Weather Detector. With this if we enter city name it will  give city's current temperature,humidity and wind speed. Here for this project I use openweatherapp.com apikeys for calculate city's current weather condition
